    <p>
        First of the festival, this talk was titled <i>6 unusual uses of gaming principles</i>. Content was interesting, really it was a selection of bits from the speaker's portfolio, but it was all implementation details as a narrative, rather than a bullet point list of what the six ideas are. It would have been nice to see list of abstractions (the principles) vs real world uses (with examples from portfolio.

    <h2>Andreas Ronning</h2>
    <p>
        A rather aggressive talk! Leading with the suggestion that advertising dev is boring (I agree, see my portfolio 2008-11!), he again bumps up against the question of what is "real" when it comes to art and work. Seems to conclude that there needs to be a physical presence beyond the screen - an oversimplification for me.<br />
        There was some interesting work presented, including a tool used to build directed graphs for museum content, which led into a discussion of being a "tools person" vs a "content person".<br />
        Finally, this guy was visibly, emotionally hurt by the downfall of Flash. It apparently hurt him so badly he has swung into full investment in Open Source, and a religious dislike of lock-in/tribalism - which for some reason has manifest as a hate of JavaScript and especially AngularJS. Highly emotional, and I disagreed with a lot of it, but still a great talk.
