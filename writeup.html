    <h2>Jop Weleins</h2>
    <p>
        First of the festival, this talk was titled <i>6 unusual uses of gaming principles</i>. Content was interesting, really it was a selection of bits from the speaker's portfolio, but it was all implementation details as a narrative, rather than a bullet point list of what the six ideas are. It would have been nice to see list of abstractions (the principles) vs real world uses (with examples from portfolio.

    <h2>Andreas Ronning</h2>
    <p>
        A rather aggressive talk! Leading with the suggestion that advertising dev is boring (I agree, see my portfolio 2008-11!), he again bumps up against the question of what is "real" when it comes to art and work. Seems to conclude that there needs to be a physical presence beyond the screen - an oversimplification for me.<br />
        There was some interesting work presented, including a tool used to build directed graphs for museum content, which led into a discussion of being a "tools person" vs a "content person".<br />
        Finally, this guy was visibly, emotionally hurt by the downfall of Flash. It apparently hurt him so badly he has swung into full investment in Open Source, and a religious dislike of lock-in/tribalism - which for some reason has manifest as a hate of JavaScript and especially AngularJS. Highly emotional, and I disagreed with a lot of it, but still a great talk.

    <h2>Frederick Vanhoutten</h2>
    <p>
        Frederick appeared with superb presence, starting out seemingly without much direction - starts questioning the value of creativity, then twisting his own words to reveal that society fails to see value. As an illustration of the poor quality of science education given, we were shown how a rainbow "works", and thus, how to simulate it. Nice little quote regarding this: "We understand unproductive play."<br />
        Originally, generative design was <em>needed</em> in order to adequately present his PhD work (relating to materials creation), but the 2004 discovery of Processing lead to an increased interest. With such a background, he seems to value systems over graphics - that is, create the simulation first, then build a visual representation from there - good approach. Another choice quote about the overexcitedness of beginners to generative art:
        "They are different, but they all look the same."

    <p>
        George Lucas repeats themes
            But it's what he knows
            Best ideas from within
        Do work for love/fear/some motivation
        Obscene
        What does client want vs what does client's audience want
        Patronising "how do you create on demand in a 9-to-5 job?"
        Work is good, but presentation hard to love

    <h2>Mr Bingo</h2>
    <p>
        This was one of the "Inspire Sessions" from the evening - a more creative, non-technical, non-specific presentation. Just what it says really, a way to get the crowd pumped and inspired. Worked very well. I came away having laughed, feeling entertained, and definitely inspired.

    <h2>Wouter Verweirder</h2>
    <p>
        Back on the practical, technical mindset for the second morning.<br />
        The first thing the crowd should have noticed is the use of a BPM counter for his heartbeat - visibly raising as the crowd began to clap (so that at first I mistook it for a BPM counter of ambient sound in the room.) Talking about this segued really well into a description of Bluetooth 4 LE, which itself led on to hobbyist hardware.<br />
        There was a somewhat interactive element, whereby the crowd all tried to get on his server to connect and play the games he'd set up. Actually this wasn't very successful at first due to the wifi, but eventually there were two "winners" brought on stage, who were fitted with heartbeat monitors, and tasked with playing games to either increase or decrease their heartrate. Again, didn't really work but the idea was really good fun.<br />
        Finally a bit of coverage of options for JavaScript use in hobbyist hardware environments, with <em>great</em> use of live video to show what the hardware is doing:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Firmata + Arduino + johnny-five<br />
                good demo of the fundementals here featuring an LED + servo motor
            </li>
            <li>Cylon.js fo rnon-Arduino hardware, with a demo using a Leap Motion</li>
            <li>Tessel board installs JS to device, nice demo</li>
            <li>Spacebrew - not clear but interesting dance mat demo</li>
        </ul>
