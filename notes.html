    <h2>Andreas Ronning</h2>
    <p>
        Advertising dev is boring
        Physical/"Real" vs on screen
        Interesting work but
            "ad-hoc" != unprepared
        Tools people vs content people
        Make flowchart with nodes, but they made the tool first
        Emotionally hurt by downfall of Flash
        Dislike of lock-in/tribalism - but why hate on angular?
        Super pretentious

    <p>
        George Lucas repeats themes
            But it's what he knows
            Best ideas from within
        Do work for love/fear/some motivation
        Obscene
        What does client want vs what does client's audience want
        Patronising "how do you create on demand in a 9-to-5 job?"
        Work is good, but presentation hard to love
