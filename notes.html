        Advertising dev is boring
        Physical/"Real" vs on screen
        Interesting work but
            "ad-hoc" != unprepared
        Tools people vs content people
        Make flowchart with nodes, but they made the tool first
        Emotionally hurt by downfall of Flash
        Dislike of lock-in/tribalism - but why hate on angular?
        Super pretentious
